I am an ambitious **Full Stack Junior Developer**, excited to start my new career path in the growing Tech industry. I have recently completed
a 16-week intensive Coding Bootcamp at Makers Academy, which has instilled in me the drive to continue enjoying my self-learning with a growth-oriented mind-set.
I am looking forward to expanding my analytical and creative problem solving skills to start creating code with real world benefits.


My background as a musician allows me to think on the fly and pick up and retain patterns very quickly. Through my Economics studies, I learned how to break down large sets of statistics into useful data and insights. 
At the other extreme, my practical building site experience demonstrates that I derive satisfaction from working consistently hard and seeing creations coming to fruition.

### <a name="skills">Skills</a>



**Fast Learner** - Able to adapt and learn new technologies quickly, having learned many different languages over the course of the bootcamp, from picking up Postgres SQL
in a week, to creating a full stack web app using Handlebars the next. I believe my musical background is very beneficial 
for this as it involves learning, recalling and distilling multiple elements of information efficiently. I am also starting to programme music,
which has helped me to learn to pick up new technologies quicker.

**Hard Worker** - I like my work to have a purpose and a competitive edge. I developed my passion for hard work on a building site moving bricks 
and cement all day: I enjoyed the exercise and the immediate satisfaction of seeing the results of my labour. Also gained valuable perspective on
working life. Similarly, I enjoyed the bootcamp. The learning environment was very intense. Having to manage so many new techniques and information 
being thrown at you was sometimes daunting, but this reinforced ignited my passion to learn.

**Creative** -  I play Drums, Guitar and Bass and particularly enjoy improvising. This requires both leading and listening skills, and combines being creative when ad-libbing, 
whilst not getting flustered if things don't go perfectly.

### <a name="experience">Work Experience</a>

**McNulty Landscaping Ltd** (July 2021 - Present)

Since a knee injury forced me to stop Hod carrying, landscaping has been great rehabilitation, as well as giving me a deeper appreciation for being out in nature. I learnt a lot about working with a smaller company and 
the logistics of being self employed, from pricing jobs to the importance of customer satisfaction.

**Hardkins Ltd** (March 2020 - April 2021)


As a Hod carrier, I learnt about all aspects of the Construction industry, from understanding the design process to helping with the creation of multi-million pound housing estates.
It showed I could adapt into any job and become a valued member of the team.


**AO Drivers** (February 2019 - November 2019)

Being a delivery driver required a lot of patience with the long hours and longer traffic jams, and a cool head to deal with the large amounts of abuse you would get. 

**The Duke of York** (March 2018 - October 2019)

As a kitchen porter/chef, I got used to working in high stress environments, doing many different jobs and having to work quickly and effeciently, sometimes in extreme heat. 
I improved my communication skills with both co-workers and clients, as well as my organisation and multitasking.

**Other work experience:**</br>
